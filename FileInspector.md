# Introduction #

The File Inspector, is a tool that will aid in writing and debugging the FileBinaryTables library and FBT compatible files. It contains a simple text editor, with a built in version of the makefbt program to build and translate, the source into compiled tables.


## Plans ##
  * It should display pointer relationship graphs
  * It should provide a way to visualize the actual class / structure data
  * It should be able to reverse file tables back into C/C++ headers.


## Ideas ##
  * Generating an XML Schema and an automatic XML parser
  * Generating ASCII tables and an automatic ASCII parser
