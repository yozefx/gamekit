# Introduction #

A cross-platform 3D game engine using Ogre or Irrlicht and Bullet for Windows, Linux, Mac and iPhone. The Ogre implementation of gamekit is called OgreKit, and the Irrlicht implementation is called IrrKit.

Only OgreKit is currently under active development. In the future it would be nice if we could develop some graphics renderer abstraction that brings OgreKit and IrrKit under the same development branch or trunk.
