# Introduction #
File Binary Tables or FBT, is a data serialization system which provides a means to store classes and structures into a set of tables.
It is derived from the .blend file format, with the idea of making it customizable and reusable in many other projects wishing to use the
same serialization methods. It has been written from the ground up to be released under the zlib license.

## Current State ##

The current state, may be checked out here.

It will always remain independent from OgreKit/GameKit and dependency free, so it can be easily extracted and used in other projects.

A full specification on the inner workings, will be written if there is a demand for it.
Since it is almost identical to the .blend format, detailed information on the .blend file structure may be found here
